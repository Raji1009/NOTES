css -  cascading style sheet
    -   language that is used to descirbe the style of a document

basic syntax-
        h1{
            color : red;
        }

        where;
            h1- selector, color-property,red-value; 

* inline :-
    <h1 style="colour:red">Cg</h1>

* <style> tag :-
    <style>
        h1{
            colour: red;
        }
    </style>

* external stylesheet :-
    writing css in a seperate document and linking it with html.
    create file-(name.css)file and 
    add the style sheet in html by code (<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"(path of the sheet if it present on different folder)>)

    external style sheet styles shouldnt be changed in the inline sheet as in that case inline gets the priority.

COLOR PROPERTY :-
    used to set the colour of the foreground (text,element such as button,link)

--> color : nameofthecolor ;

BACKGROUND COLOUR PROPERTY :-
    used to set the colour of the background

--> body tag is used to the change color of the page; etc....
        body{
            background-color : black;
        }

COLOUR SYSTEM :-
    * color system :-
        --> color: rgb(0-255,0-255,0-255);
        
        -->  Hex (Hexadecimal):
                color : ## {
                    16 digits, 0-9(10)a,b,c,d,e,f(6)
                }

        -->  use colourhunt (for the pallete colour for projects)

SELECTORS :-
        -> universal selector :
                *{} (use for all in one changing the color)

        -> element selector :
                h1{} (only specificy the element mentioned and change its color)

        -> class selector :
                .myclass{} (specifiy the area where the class is mentioned in the code)

        -> Id selector :
                #idname{} (specify the area where the id are mentioned)

        { class is used where the same design is used for various type of elements and different place }
        { in case of id is used when there is only few changed in the area }
    
    ## to create class and id based div shorcuts are .myclass and #myid respectively
         
TEXT PROPERTIES :-

        -> text-align 
                text-align:left/right/center ; {default :left}     ##align the text (depend upon the parent)

        { #in case of other lanuages# text-align: start; (left);end(right)}

        -> text-decorations 
            text-decoration : line/line-through/underline; {
                to remove underline in the anchor tag using "none" there will no underline (usecase)
            }

        -> font weight: normal/bold/bolder/lighter;
                weight : 100-900
                { { #h1
                    font-weight
                  }
                    <h1 id="h1">HELLO</h1>
                    <h1 id="h1">HELLO</h1>
                    <h1 id="h1">HELLO</h1>
                }

        -> font-family : text-style
                { { #h1
                    font-family : arial
               }
                    <h1 id="h1">HELLO</h1>
                    <h1 id="h1">HELLO</h1>
                    <h1 id="h1">HELLO</h1>
                }

        -> line-height property :
                {
                    line-height : in pixels (gap between lines)
                }

        -> text-transform : 
                {
                    text-transform : uppercase/lowercase/capitalize(capitalize the first letter of every word)/none;
                
                }

    --<few properties in css are changes in parent form apply to child>--


UNITS IN CSS : 

        -> ABSOLUTE ;
                *Pixels (px)
                    1 inch-96px
                    [front-size:24px}

                                                        BOX MODEL

                                            
                                                <img src="image copy.png">

-> HEIGTH;
<height : 100px;>
height of the content box 
By default it sets the content area of the element

-> WIDTH;
<widht : 100px>
    width of the content box
    By default it sets the content area mostly over the screen

-> BORDER;
used to set an element's border {
    border-width:in pixles;
    border-style:solid/dashed/dotted/doubleborder;
    border-color:colours;
    (text align in box will align inside the box, inside the given area)
    border {shorthand} :width:style:color;
    border-radius : used to round the corners of an elements outer border edge {in pixles or in percentage} (to get circle have to fix border radius to 50%)

}

-> PADDING;
space or gap between the content box and border is padding
    ->padding-top:in pixles;P{}
    ->padding-bottom:in pixles;
    ->padding-left:in pixles;
    ->padding-right:in pixles;

    onelinecode{
        padding:top/right/bottom/left;
    }

-> MARGIN; 
space between the border of an element and the border of another element
    ->margin-top:in pixles;
    ->margin-bottom:in pixles;
    ->margin-right:in pixles;
    ->margin-left:in pixles;

    onelinecode{
        margin: top/right/bottom/left;
    }

{for all the website enter the universal padding margin and border as 0; }

DISPLAY PROPERTY :-
    display-inline/block/inline-block/none;
        ->inline
            takes only the space required by the element.(no margin/padding)

        ->inline-block
            similar to inline but we can set margin & padding

        ->block
            takes full space available in width
            {takes the full space and goes to the next line}

        ->none
            to remove elemnt fron document flow {no place for the element place}

    {inline for block elements(no there for top and bottom) so to set padding and margin there is inline-block
    inline-block for inline elements (there for top and bottom) so to set padding and margin there}

        visibility property:
            visibility-hidden;
            when the visibility is set to none,space for the element is reserved whereas when the display is none there is no sapce or blocked 
        
        ALPHA CHANNEL :-
            OPACITY (0-1);
            RGBA;
                color:rgba(0/1,0/1,0/1,1/0)
                    (0 being very light and 1 being very dark)
                
Units in CSS :
    Relatve-size>:
            ->%:
                relative to the parent element (if width of parent is 100px and width of child is 30% then the child width is 30%of parent px)
            ->em:
                relative to the font size of the parent element in case of font size (em times the parent size) 
                but in the case of width it will depend upon the frontsize of the same element
            ->rem:
                relative to the font size of the root element (i.e the size of the body element)
            ->vw:
                relative to the width of the viewport
            ->vh:
                relative to the height of the viewport
            ->vmin:
                relative to the minimum of the viewport
            ->vmax:
                relative to the maximum of the viewport
            ->px:
                relative to the pixel
            ->cm:
                relative to the centimeter
            ->mm:
                relative to the millimeter

                relative to the point
            ->pc:
                relative to the pica
            ->ex:
                relative to the x-height of the font
            ->ch:
                relative to the width of the character '0'

    position :-
        the position css property sets how an element is position in the box;  {enter #box1 and will give the emmet as the div box with id of box1}
        position : static/relative/absolute/fixed;

        {Z-index :- 
                it decided the stacklevel of the elements;
                        if the z-index is higher then the element will be on top of the other element
                        if the z-index is lower then the element will be below the other element
                        if the z-index is same then the element will be on the top of the other element
                        if the z-index is not specified then the element will be on the top of the other element
                
                - Z-index : auto(0)
                - Z-index : 1/2/...
                - Z-index : -1/-2/...

        }

        -> static : default position (the top,right,bottom,left and z-index properties have no effect)
        -> relative : element is relative to itself (the top,right ,bottom,left and z-index will work)
                {
                    maybe overlap to the next element
                }
        -> absolute : positioned relative to its -closest positioned ancestor- (like the parent div or parent body). (removed from flow)
                {
                    based on the document by removing from the flow but will move when scrolled
                }

        -> fixed : positioned relative to browser (removed from flow)
                {
                    whole document based and will be same even when scrolled
                }
        -> sticky : positioned based on user's scroll position.

    background-image:
            -> url('image.jpg') : image.jpg is the image
            -> url('image.jpg') url('image2.jpg') : image.jpg and image2.jpg
            {
                <img src="" alt="" srcset="">
                unplash.com using for high resolution copyrights free images...
                or in stylesheet {
                    background-image : url("enter the url of image(path)");
                }
            }
        
        background- size :
                background-size : cover (completly filled into the box) / 
                                  contain (image will fit but they priority to see the image completly) they can repeat {to remove we will set background-repeat:no-repeat}/
                                  auto (enlarged image)

    FLEX-BOX :
            flexible box layout:

            it is a one dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows and columns.
                it is a layout method that is used to create a flexible and responsive layout.
            
                <img src="image copy.png"> {
                    flex-item :
                    flex-container :
                    main axis : (horizontal can be changed)
                    cross-axis : (vertical can be changed)
                }

        the flex properties : {
                (to fix in the size they adjust their size until the font size allow)

                flex-direction : row/column/row-reversed/column-reversed (default is row)
                                (how flex items are placed in flex container, along which axis and direction) 
                                        -> row:left to right(main axis)
                                        -> row-revsersed : right to left (main axis)
                                        -> column : vertically arranged (main axis) top to bottom
                                        -> column reversed : verticaaly arranged bottom to top (main axis)

                flex-wrap : wrap/nowrap (default is nowrap)

                justify-content : space-between/space-around(extra space)/space-evenly (default is space-between)
                                  flex-start (main-axis ka start)/ flex-end(main-axis ka end) / centre / space-evenly/

                align-items : center/stretch/flex-start/flex-end (default is stretch)
                        -> align-self : alignment of individual along the cross-axis
                                highest priority

                        -> flex-grow : how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items if space is available
                                
                        -> flex-shrink : how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items if space is available


                align-content : center/stretch/flex-start/flex-end (default is stretch)
                                ->center : all elements content is aligned centre

            }

    Media Queries :-
            help create a responsive website (responsive - for change the allignment and orientation according to the screen we use)

            @media (width : 600px){
                div{
                    background-color :red;
                }
            }
             ( when the device width reaches exactly 600px the background of the div changes its color to red not when less or more than 600px)

            @media (min-width : 600px){
                div{
                    background-color :red;
                    }
            }
             ( when the device width reaches 600px or more the background color of the div changed to red its euqal/greater-than)
             ( when the device width is until 600px the  background color of the div changed to red its equal/less-than)

                                                    Transforms /  animation

    transitions :
                    pesudo div is used in  transition
            transitions enable you to define the transition between two states of an element.
                              hover-move,active-on clicking the button  

                -> transition-property : property you want to transition (front-soze,width etc..)
                                      
                -> transition-duration : 2s/4ms.. time duration of how much the transition should take place

                -> transition-timing-function : speed and type of effect it uses on moving the mouse there
                                                ease-in / ease-out /  ease-in-out / linear / cubic-bezier(how much time there should be transition)

                -> transition-delay : 2s / 4ms... (hoe much time there will be delay after hovering)

        -->transition shorthand:
                        transition : 2s ease-in-out 2s 2s
                transition : property-name || duration || timing-function || delay


        -->CSS transform :
            used to apply   2D and  3D transformation to an element (also apply on the content and element inside the div if applied on div)

            ->Rotate :
                transform: rotate(45deg)
                    *rotate:45deg;
                    *rotateX:45deg;
                    *rotateY:45deg;
                    *rotateZ:45Z;

            -> Scale :
                transform : scale(2)   (scale the element to 2 times its original size)
                transform : scale(0.5)
                transform : scale(1,2)
                transform : scaleX(0.5);
                transform : scaleY(0.5)    
                transform : scaleZ(0.5)

            -> translate : (it keeps moving on hovering on it)
                transform : translate(20px); (x axis direction, y axis direction)
                transform : translate(20px,50px);
                transform : translateX(20px);
                transform : translateY(20px);

            -> skew :
                transform : skew(30deg) (it will bend or it will curve according to the deg given)

    Animation ;
        to animate CSS elements (it will move from change (strating frame) - to change (end frame))
            
            @keyframe myName {
                from {front-size:20px}
                to {front-size : 40px}
            }

        Animation-properties :
            -> animation-name:
            ->animation-duration:
            ->animation-timing-function:
            ->animation-delay:
            ->animation-iteration-count:
                how many times the animation should repeat
            ->animation-direction:
                what direction should it move or animate
                normal -cycle / reverse - to&fro / alternate / alternate-rev

            animation-shorthand :-
                animation : name ||  duration || timing-func || delay || iteration-count || direction ||;
                animation : myname 2s linear 0s 2 normal;

            % in animation :
                    what should happen if x% of animation is over
                @keyframe myname {
                    0%{front-size:20px}
                    50%{}
                    100%{}
                }
